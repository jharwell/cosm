XML Conventions
---------------

- Multiple choices for an XML attribute value are separated by a ``|`` in the
  example XML.

- XML attributes that should be floating point are specified as ``FLOAT`` in the
  example XML (acceptable range, if applicable, is documented for each
  individual attribute).

- XML attributes that should be integers are specified as ``INTEGER`` in the
  example XML (acceptable range, if applicable, is documented for each
  individual attribute).
