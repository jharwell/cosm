# Strictly speaking, linking libfoo.so -> libfoo.1.2.3.so in package libfoo is
# BAD. Symlinks like that go in -dev .deb packages (I don't know why). BUT, the
# packaging guidelines say for small packages with both runtime+development
# files, it is OK to override this warning. See
# https://www.debian.org/doc/debian-policy/ch-sharedlibs.html#development-files.
